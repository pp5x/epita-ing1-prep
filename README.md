## Introduction

Welcome to EPITA (School of Computer Science and Advanced Techniques). If you
are reading this, it's probably because you want to prepare to join ING1 (first
year of the engineering cycle). This guide is intended for students who passed
the Advance Parall√®le or Advance CPGE exam. As August is coming to an end and
the start of the school year is approaching, whether you are reviewing your
programming courses or relaxing by the pool, this guide will help you start the
year a bit more prepared. Speaking of the **Piscine**...

### Preparing for the Piscine

Since the school's inception in 1984, the Piscine has been a C/UNIX programming
workshop. You will learn the basics of C programming, implement algorithms,
data structures from scratch, and build simple programs that interface with the
operating system. This *resource* workshop lays the foundation for students to
later undertake increasingly complex programming projects, first individually
and then in teams. Collaboration on larger and larger projects, akin to working
in a company, is emphasized. This expertise is acquired over time and through
regular programming practice.

### Computer Science Harmonization

EPITA stands out with a specific identity in the construction of its
activities. The aim is to gain *expertise* in computer science and become
*efficient* in project execution.

To acclimate, the first month offers the following courses (for those new to
computer science or with little practice):

- My PC & UNIX Systems
- Algorithms and Data Structures
- Introduction to Programming
- Computer Architecture

The goal of computer science harmonization is to make everyone enjoy
programming, personalize their system, understand *why* things are the way they
are, and *how* everything works! In other words, learning is not just
theoretical; it is facilitated by establishing a particular *environment*. You
will need to step out of your comfort zone and consider constraints.

### Specifically?

Here is a non-exhaustive list of what you will be expected to do:

- Install Linux natively on your personal machine and configure it
- Use a terminal to type shell command lines
- Chain commands to process data
- Use a text-mode editor like `vim` or `emacs`
- Reimplement a data structure such as a linked list in C using a memory
  allocator
- Compile and run your program from the command line
- Personalize your work environment under i3
- Learn to type efficiently (typing)
- Program in assembly language in an emulator
- Use `git` to save your work

## Resources

While waiting to access the educational content provided by EPITA, here is a
collection of various resources you could explore for about two weeks
(regularity is more important than quantity).

Don't worry if you don't cover everything; it's long and that's normal! We will
see all of this soon.

### Linux

Linux is an operating system like Windows or MacOS. Programming is taught
almost exclusively on this platform.

#### Level 1: Ubuntu

If you have never used Linux, I recommend Ubuntu as your first distribution.

You will find an introduction to Linux oriented towards Ubuntu at the following
address:

- [OpenClassRooms - Get Started with
  Linux](https://openclassrooms.com/en/courses/7170491-get-started-with-linux)

#### Level 2: ArchLinux

If you have already installed Linux and are comfortable with the command line
and file editing, I recommend doing an [ArchLinux](https://wiki.archlinux.org/)
installation (in a virtual machine at first, but then consider having it
natively).

ArchLinux is a distribution where you start from scratch to build your system.
This principle leads the user to solve problems as they wish to have additional
features (such as wifi).

- [ArchLinux - Installation
  Guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide)

Recommended window manager (WM): i3

### Programming

#### Python

First, ensure you can write small programs, algorithms in Python, and if
possible, implement data structures.

This is also an opportunity, if you have never done so, to get interested in
*testing* (pytest) which validates the proper functioning of code. They are
essential for building larger programs but also allow for faster programming.

#### C/UNIX

Focus on memory management and data structures.

- <https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1>
- [VisuAlgo](https://visualgo.net)

#### What to focus on?

- String manipulation
- Array manipulation and search algorithms
- Implementation of linked lists (with chaining)

### Text Editor

#### vim

`vim` will probably be your text editor for the upcoming semester. Once
accustomed to "modal" editing, you become very efficient in modifying or
navigating text. A tutorial is usually installed with the editor and can be
started with `vimtutor`.

There are numerous online resources:

- <https://github.com/iggredible/Learn-Vim>

Don't make it a priority; the most important thing is to be comfortable with
your editor to write some programs in Python or C.
